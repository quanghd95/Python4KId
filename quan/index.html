    <div class="hobby">
      <h2>Chess</h2>
      <p>When I was six years old, I began playing chess, but my mother pulled me out of the class because she didn't think I would succeed in it. I start playing again in seventh grade, and I really enjoy it because the games are challenging and it's fun to experience more sports.</p>
