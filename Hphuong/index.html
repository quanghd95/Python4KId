  <h1> Hobbies </h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reading</strong> 
    <br> Since the past 3 years, I’ve taken the habit of reading 100 books in a year. This may sound daunting, but it is definitely achievable with some dedication and planning.
    <br> First and foremost, reading many books can improve your knowledge and broaden your horizons. With each book you read, you will be exposed to new ideas and perspectives that can expand your understanding of the world. It will also get you to build interesting connections between apparently unrelated things (like, between Japanese food and Product Design - but that's a story for another day).

 <br>I also noticed that reading improves your vocabulary and language skills. As you read, you will encounter new words and phrases that can expand your vocabulary and improve your ability to communicate effectively. This can be particularly useful for students and professionals who need strong language skills in their work.

 <br>Another benefit of reading frequently, is that it can enhance your concentration and focus. By setting aside dedicated time to read, you can train your mind to focus and concentrate on a single task, which can improve your productivity and overall mental health.

<br>Furthermore, reading can be a great way to relax and unwind after a long day. By setting aside time to read each day, you can create a relaxing and restorative routine that can improve your mental well-being.

<br>That's it: reading books can make you smarter, more well-spoken, and more focused. And it will also make you the life of the party (or at least the most annoying person at the party).

 <li><strong>Cooking</strong> 
  <ul> <br>I love that cooking gives me a chance to be creative and indulge in some ‘play’ time – something we adults could do with a lot more. I adore losing myself in the rituals of chopping, stirring and tasting.

<br>When you’re cooking you get to choose what you make AND what goes into each dish. You also get to choose the quality of the ingredients. So it’s easy to make things that are the most delicious to you.

<br>Love chilli (like I do)? Then add more. Love sharp, acidic flavours (like I do)? Then add a splash of vinegar or a squeeze of lemon.

Think of it as a choose your own (tasty) adventure.

<br>The more I learn about nutrition the more I’ve come to realize that the most important factor for healthy eating is to avoid processed food and focus on using real ingredients.

And the best way to do this? Cook for yourself as much as you can.

<br>Spending 30 minutes in the kitchen preparing dinner will put me in a much calmer, less frazzled mood than sitting on the couch for the same amount of time.

Plus it gives me an opportunity to nurture my family and friends. To express my love and take care of them.


<br>As much as I’d like to think that all these lofty benefits were what first got me into cooking, really, it was the praise.

Hearing the words ‘this is amazing’ was a huge motivator for me to keep spending time in the kitchen when I was learning to cook.

And still is.
  </ul> 
  <li><strong>Writing</strong> 
    <ul><br> I love to write because it allows my mind to go to anyplace it wants to with no restrictions. Writing, I've found,is a way to express myself in ways I may not otherwise be comfortable doing. I enjoy writing because I love being able to express myself and my own ideas. I enjoy writing because it has so much freedom.
